        <p>
          As you scroll through, you will find a collection of pictures that
          tell stories of my snowboarding adventures. Spoiler alert: most of
          them involve a stack of some description. From fails to wipeouts,
          these moments are all part of the journey - this was obviously said by
          someone who did not fall because from personal experience I can
          confirm - it hurts. Join me as I share the laughs, the beer and the
          sheer joy of the sport.

First REAL Website...Just experimenting with different things
Updated the main page so that i have 4 blocks which link to different parts of the website - eventually will have images on them. need to also change the headline on the first page currently have a placement. Trying to get it looking as clean as possible.

Editing the articles page need to figure out how I want to set it out. thinking either 2 columns - also need to add some articles etc.

            <p> I was Born <br> I generally consider this the biggest mistake of my life since it has caused me nothing
                but pain and sufferning.</p>
            <p> First time I started playing Chess and I never really stopped. Still absloutley shit though...</p>

            <p> Started Secondary school, learnt some stuff, made some friends, did not die. Overall I rate it as a
                sucess</p>
            <p> It was coming but decided to make it official just before NY - FYI to any parents who are reading this,
                it
                is a great way to make your kids hate Christmas </p>

            <p> Bit shit</p>
            <p> Best decision of my life - I hated my degree and went for all the wrong reasons. Should of never gone in
                the first place but got to love that immigrant family pressure mixed with generational trauma. </p>

            <p> It was emotional, met some cool people met some really shit people and still have not worked out why the
